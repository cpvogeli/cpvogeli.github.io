| __Meeting Time__ | Fridays, 11am-12pm |
| __Meeting Place__ | Malott 310D |

This is the webpage for HoMoToPIESS, an informal seminar for homotopically-minded graduate students at Cornell. The organizers are [Chase Vogeli](https://chasevoge.li/) and [Kimball Strong](https://e.math.cornell.edu/people/Kimball_Strong/).

This semester's topic is __algebraic $$K$$-theory__. Some references for the material we will discuss include:
- Blumberg--Gepner--Tabuada, [A universal characterization of higher algebraic K-theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2282)
- Loday, [Cyclic Homology](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-11389-9)
- Quillen, [On the cohomology and $$K$$-theory of the general linear groups over a finite field](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970825)
