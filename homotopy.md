| __Meeting Time__ | Fridays, 11am-12pm |
| __Meeting Place__ | Malott 310D |

This is the webpage for HoMoToPIESS, an informal seminar for homotopically-minded graduate students at Cornell. The organizers are [Chase Vogeli](https://chasevoge.li/) and [Kimball Strong](https://e.math.cornell.edu/people/Kimball_Strong/).

This semester's topic is __algebraic $$K$$-theory__. Some references for the material we will discuss include:
- Quillen, [On the cohomology and $$K$$-theory of the general linear groups over a finite field](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970825)
- Weibel, [The $$K$$-book: an introduction to algebraic $$K$$-theory](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/Kbook.html)
- Waldhausen, [Algebraic $$K$$-theory of spaces](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~fw/algebraic_K_theory_of_spaces.pdf)
- Zakharevich, [The annihilator of the Lefschetz motive](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/duke-mathematical-journal/volume-166/issue-11/The-annihilator-of-the-Lefschetz-motive/10.1215/00127094-0000016X.full)
