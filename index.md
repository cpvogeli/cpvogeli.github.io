I'm a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics at [Cornell University](https://math.cornell.edu), advised by [Inna Zakharevich](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~zakh). I will be on the postdoctoral job market in the fall of 2025.

I'm an algebraic topologist, focusing on algebraic K-theory and equivariant stable homotopy theory. I've recently taken an interest in connections to modular representation theory.

<!-- __equivariant algebra__: the study of [Mackey functors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackey_functor) equivariant stable homotopy theory -->

[__CV__](assets/pdf/cv-cv-2025-10-15.pdf) (Last updated: October 15, 2025)

I pronounce my last name as "VOH-guh-lee" in English, but it's really [Swiss German](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/V%C3%B6geli) in origin.

<!-- __Some things I'm involved in:__
- I organize the <a href="https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/cornell-drp">Cornell Directed Reading Program</a> along with [Alekos Robotis](https://aarobotis.github.io/). -->

<!-- - I organize [HoMoToPIESS](homotopy) along with [Kimball Strong](https://e.math.cornell.edu/people/Kimball_Strong/). -->
