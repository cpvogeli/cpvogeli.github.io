I'm a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics at [Cornell University](https://math.cornell.edu), advised by [Inna Zakharevich](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~zakh). 

I enjoy thinking about mathematics at the interface between algebra and topology. In particular, I'm interested in

- equivariant stable homotopy theory,
- algebraic K-theory, and
- homological methods in finite group theory.

I pronounce my last name as "VOH-guh-lee" in English, but it's really [Swiss German](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/V%C3%B6geli) in origin.

__Some things I'm involved in:__
- I organize the <a href="https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/cornell-drp">Cornell Directed Reading Program</a> along with [Alekos Robotis](https://aarobotis.github.io/).

<!-- - I organize [HoMoToPIESS](homotopy) along with [Kimball Strong](https://e.math.cornell.edu/people/Kimball_Strong/). -->
