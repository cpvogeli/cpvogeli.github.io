One of my interests outside mathematics is jazz music. While at MIT, I was the drummer for the [Festival Jazz Ensemble](https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/festival-jazz-ensemble), where I had some incredible performance opportunities such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK2alHTZpNk).
